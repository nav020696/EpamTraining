Test Quadratic Equation
This exercise is about getting familiar with parametrized unit testing and JUnit 4.12 approach in particular.

First, you need to design and code a  method in the QuadraticEquation class.
Here are some details:

the method must solve a quadratic equation specified by three coefficients given as parameters: a,b,c.
first parameter  might not be zero. If it is, throw an IllegalArgumentException.
the  method return a string in of three formats:
x1 x2
x1
no roots
Next, you need to complete the test classes:

QuadraticEquationNoRootsCasesTesting
QuadraticEquationSingleRootCasesTesting
QuadraticEquationTwoRootsCasesTesting
QuadraticEquationZeroACasesTesting
Those are parameterized test classes, so take that into account. You have to provide at least 4 test cases for each one of the classes.
Also, you may not change signature of their constructors.

In order to pass the exercise, your tests must correctly detect flaws of some other sorting method implementations.
There are special tests in several classes that applies your tests to your and some of such bad implementations.

Your solution method must pass your tests, and others must fail in some cases.

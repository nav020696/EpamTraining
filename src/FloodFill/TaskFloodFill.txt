Flood Fill

Description
Implement com.epam.rd.autocode.floodfill.FloodFill getInstance method.
It should return a FloodFill instance.
Flood fill means it takes initial rectangular area containing land and water cells and imitates flooding it:
each flood step water cell converts neighbor land cells (up, left, right and down) to water.
It takes some steps to completely flood an area and after that algorithm stops.
You must implement FloodFill in recursive manner and make flood method call itself until all the area becomes water.
Method takes two parameters:


String map is an area representation using
char (█) for land cells,
char (░) for water cells and
char ("\n") for line breaks;

FloodLogger logger is a current flood state logger.
Call logger.log(String floodState) to report a flood state on each step. Make sure to call it once per flood method call.
